# Stock Price Prediction

This Python script uses linear regression to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:


## Usage

1. Ensure you have your historical stock data in a CSV file named `stock_data.csv`.

2. Modify the `file_path` variable in the script to point to the location of your CSV file.

3. Run the script using Python:


4. The script will load the data, preprocess it, train a linear regression model, evaluate the model, and visualize the predictions.

## Description of Functions

- `load_data(file_path)`: Loads the dataset from the specified CSV file.
- `preprocess_data(data)`: Preprocesses the data by converting the 'Date' column to datetime and sorting the dataframe by date.
- `feature_engineering(data)`: Performs feature engineering. Currently, it only selects the 'Close' price as a feature.
- `split_data(features, target)`: Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- `train_model(X_train, y_train)`: Trains a linear regression model using the training data.
- `evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)`: Evaluates the model using mean squared error.
- `visualize_results(actual, predicted)`: Visualizes the actual and predicted stock prices using matplotlib.
- `main()`: Main function that orchestrates the entire process.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use this script:

```python
python stock_prediction.py
