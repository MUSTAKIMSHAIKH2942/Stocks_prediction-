# Stock Price Prediction

Developed a robust stock price prediction model leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast future stock prices with high accuracy. The model was designed to assist in financial decision-making by predicting daily closing prices of stocks.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:

Key Responsibilities:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Collected historical stock price data from various financial sources.
Performed data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure data quality and suitability for time series analysis.
Created new features such as moving averages, trading volume, and technical indicators to enrich the dataset.
Model Development:

Implemented LSTM neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
Designed the model architecture with multiple LSTM layers to capture long-term dependencies in the data.
Tuned hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, units per layer, learning rate) to optimize model performance.
Training and Validation:

Split data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance.
Used techniques such as early stopping and dropout to prevent overfitting.
Evaluated model accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Deployment and Visualization:

Deployed the model to a cloud platform for real-time prediction.
Developed a user-friendly dashboard using Flask and Plotly to visualize predictions and actual stock prices.
Implemented an API for integration with other financial tools and platforms.
Technologies Used:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries and Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Plotly
Deployment: Flask, AWS/GCP
Key Achievements:

Successfully predicted stock prices with a high degree of accuracy, outperforming traditional time series models.
Achieved a reduction in prediction error by fine-tuning the LSTM model and incorporating advanced preprocessing techniques.
Enabled real-time stock price predictions, providing valuable insights for investors and financial analysts.
